# **Week_3-Project - Pipeline**
## Renewable Energy and Energy Price Relationship in Spain 

The hyptohesis for the project is the following:

*Generating energy with renewable alternatives decreases the energy market price* 

In order to prove the hypothesis I will download a dataset from kaggle and call an API to unit both set of information to obtain the necessary data for our testing. 

1. The folder "J Notebook" contains all the cleaning of the dataframes, merging the kaggle dataframe and the api dataframe and the final visualization with explanation with the respective graphs.  
2. The folder Data contains the csv files que the different dataframes we have modified and dowloaded during the project. 
3. The folder Outputs contains screenshots of various graphs from the visualization jupyter-notebook. 

The intention of this project is to encourage and raise awarness of clean energy. Not only does it save our planet from mass extincction, it also saves us money.
